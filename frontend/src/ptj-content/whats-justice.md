**What is justice for you?**  
*Kung ginawan ka ng mali, paano mo ito gustong maitama?*
<br />

Justice is one of the most powerful ideas that shape our lives, yet it remains difficult to define. Sa mga simpleng usapan man o sa mga malalaking usapin sa lipunan, iba-iba ang pananaw natin sa kung ano ang makatarungan. Kaya ngayong araw, pag-usapan natin:  
<br />

**Ano nga ba ang hustisya para sa’yo?**

<br />

**PUNITIVE JUSTICE**  
*“Dapat makulong ang may sala.”*

For many, justice means **punishment**. When someone commits a wrong, justice is served when the law holds them accountable—often through imprisonment or legal sanction. This is called **punitive justice**, a system rooted in the idea that wrongdoing deserves penalty. It's the most common form of justice we see in courts and law enforcement.

<br />
 
**RETRIBUTIVE JUSTICE**  
*“Gantihan para makabawi.”*

Retributive justice focuses on **revenge** or **rebalancing**: “An eye for an eye.” Ang layunin nito ay bumawi. To make the scales even. Kung ano ang kinuha sa’yo, dapat ibalik. If you caused harm, you should suffer the same.  

This kind of justice feels intuitive—lalo na sa mga sugat na sariwa pa. It gives a sense of control to the victim, especially in a world where so many harms go unanswered. 

<br />
 
**RECONCILIATORY JUSTICE**  
*“Pagpapatawad at pakikipag-ayos.”*

Some forms of justice are **relational**. Reconciliatory justice seeks **forgiveness**, **mercy**, and **healing** between the wrongdoer and the harmed. Minsan hindi sapat ang parusa. Ang mahalaga, may pag-amin sa mali, may paghingi ng tawad, at may pagbubukas ng puso sa muling pag-uusap.

We often see this in indigenous practices or in community-based approaches where relationships matter more than punishment. It does not erase pain—but it opens the door for transformation through dialogue. Ngunit hindi rin ito madaling proseso. Forgiveness cannot be forced. It takes time, trust, and accountability.

<br />
 
**RESTORATIVE JUSTICE**  
*“Bawiin ang dangal ng biktima.”*

Restorative justice focuses on **repairing harm**. Hindi lang ito tungkol sa pagpapatawad—kundi sa muling pagbawi ng dignidad. In this approach, the goal is not just to punish the wrongdoer but to **restore** what was lost, whether materially, emotionally, or socially.

It requires the offender to take responsibility and actively participate in making things right. Victims, in turn, are given space to share their truth, be heard, and be centered in the process. This method is now being explored in schools, courts, and transitional justice settings around the world.

Restorative justice recognizes that not all harm can be undone—but dignity can still be reclaimed.

<br />
 
**TRANSFORMATIVE JUSTICE**  
*“Itama ang sistemang ugat ng mali.”*

Beyond the personal level, **transformative justice** zooms out to ask: what kind of society allowed this harm to happen in the first place? Kung may karahasan, pang-aabuso, o kawalan ng hustisya, paano natin babaguhin ang mga sistemang pinanggalingan nito?

Transformative justice aims for **systemic change**. It recognizes that crimes don’t happen in a vacuum—they are shaped by poverty, inequality, discrimination, and historical trauma. This approach is often used in grassroots movements and post-conflict societies aiming for collective healing, not just individual punishment.

<br />
 
This kind of justice isn’t about retribution or apology—it’s about liberation. About building new structures that prevent future harm.
<br />
 

Whether through **punishment, retribution, reconciliation, restoration**, or **transformation**, justice is our attempt to **right a wrong**. It is both personal and political, intimate and institutional. From our daily lives to our nation’s legal systems, justice is the ideal we reach for when harm has been done.

Sa huli, ang hustisya ay hindi lang konsepto. Isa itong pagkilos. A call to act, to speak, to build, and to repair. Dahil ang lipunang kayang itama ang mali, ay lipunang tunay na makatao.
<br />
 
 Para sa’yo, ano ang hustisya?
