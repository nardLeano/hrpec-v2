**What is justice for you?**  
*Kung ginawan ka ng mali, paano mo ito gustong maitama?*
<br />

Justice is one of the most powerful ideas that shape our lives, yet it remains difficult to define. Sa mga simpleng usapan man o sa mga malalaking usapin sa lipunan, iba-iba ang pananaw natin sa kung ano ang makatarungan. Kaya ngayong araw, pag-usapan natin:  
<br />

**Ano nga ba ang hustisya para sa’yo?**

<br />

Justice may equate to legal punishment, imprisonment, or what we call punitive action.  

Para sa iba, ang kahulugan ng hustisya ay pagpapakulong sa mga may sala.  

Kung makikita nilang pinanagot ng batas ang gumawa ng mali.  
<br />

**Punitive justice** is rooted in criminal law and focuses on punishment administered by state institutions. It relies on rules, legal frameworks, and due process to penalize actions considered harmful to individuals or society. The logic is deterrence and accountability: by punishing the offender, others are discouraged from committing the same offense. 
<br />

  
<br />

Or justice could be retributive— sought through revenge or “an eye for an eye”.  

Maari rin namang pagganti o pagbawi sa nakagawa ng mali.  

Para kwits! To make even. Para patas lang. Kuhain ang katumbas ng kinuha sa iyo.  
<br />

**Retributive justice** centers on proportionality—giving the wrongdoer a punishment equal to the harm they caused. It is one of the oldest forms of justice, evident in early legal systems like the Code of Hammurabi. Unlike punitive justice, which is state-centered, retributive justice is often personal and emotional in nature. In transitional justice settings, it can also appear as demands for compensation or symbolic payback.  
<br />

  
<br />

It may also be seen as reconciliatory, involving forgiveness and mercy.  

Minsan naman maaaring patungkol ito sa pagpapatawad. Pag-alegro o pakikipag-ayos.  
<br />

**Reconciliatory justice** focuses on restoring broken relationships between parties after harm. It is often practiced in post-conflict societies or indigenous communities where collective well-being is prioritized. This form can include truth-telling processes, apology rituals, or community dialogue, such as South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Its goal is to allow parties to move forward without revenge or resentment.
<br />

  
<br />

It could be restorative, an effort to return impaired or lost dignity.  

Bukod naman sa pakikipag-ayos, ang pag-aayos. Ang muling pagbawi sa dangal ng biktima.  
<br />

**Restorative justice** is a structured process involving the victim, the offender, and the community. It seeks to acknowledge harm, restore dignity, and rebuild trust. Commonly used in schools, youth justice, and some criminal cases, restorative practices involve mediated encounters or restitution. Studies suggest it can reduce recidivism and improve victim satisfaction compared to conventional punishment. 
<br />

  
<br />

It may also be transformative for the whole community or society to be changed for the better.  

Hustisyang layunin ay pagbabago. Pagtama sa sistema na pinagmumulan ng mali.  

Hindi lang para sa iilan, kundi para sa lipunan bilang kabuuan.  
<br />

**Transformative justice** goes beyond individual wrongdoing and addresses the systemic roots of harm—such as racism, poverty, or gender inequality. It is often community-led and operates outside formal legal systems. Its aim is not only to repair harm but to restructure the conditions that allowed it to occur. This approach is used in grassroots activism, abolitionist organizing, and post-conflict state rebuilding.
<br />

  
<br />

In whichever process and means we prefer it to be done, **justice is to right a wrong.**  

From individual experiences to broader social issues, justice is our ideal and fair way of protecting our rights and punishing wrongdoings.  

Dahil ang lipunang itinatama ang mali, ay lipunang Makatao  
<br />

We’d like to hear your thoughts!  
<br />

**Para sa’yo, ano ang hustisya?**
