**What is Justice for you?**  
<br />

Kung ginawan ka ng mali, paano mo ito gustong maitama?  
<br />

**Ano nga ba ang itsura ng hustisya?**  
<br />

Pag-usapan natin >>>  
<br />

Justice may equate to legal punishment, imprisonment, or what we call punitive action.  
<br />

Para sa iba, ang kahulugan ng hustisya ay pagpapakulong sa mga may sala.  
<br />

Kung makikita nilang pinanagot ng batas ang gumawa ng mali.  
<br />

**Punitive justice** is one of the most dominant legal models in the world today. It focuses on penalizing the offender, often through incarceration. For example, as of 2022, the Philippines had over [130,000 persons deprived of liberty](https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1192226), with jails operating at 387% congestion rate—raising questions about the effectiveness and humanity of punitive justice. Critics argue that overreliance on punishment doesn't address the root causes of crime and often neglects victims’ needs for healing.  
<br />

  
<br />

Or justice could be retributive— sought through revenge or “an eye for an eye”.  
<br />

Maari rin namang pagganti o pagbawi sa nakagawa ng mali.  
<br />

Para kwits! To make even. Para patas lang. Kuhain ang katumbas ng kinuha sa iyo.  
<br />

**Retributive justice** is built on the principle of proportionality—“you get what you deserve.” In many justice systems, this philosophy underpins criminal sentencing. However, retributive frameworks have been criticized for fostering cycles of violence. A 2021 UNODC report notes that in post-conflict settings, revenge killings often increase when formal justice mechanisms fail, showing how unresolved harm can spiral without meaningful resolution. ([UNODC, 2021](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/justice-and-prison-reform/index.html))  
<br />

  
<br />

It may also be seen as reconciliatory, involving forgiveness and mercy.  
<br />

Minsan naman maaaring patungkol ito sa pagpapatawad. Pag-alegro o pakikipag-ayos.  
<br />

**Reconciliatory justice** emphasizes emotional and social repair, often involving truth-telling, apologies, and forgiveness. It's central to processes like South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which investigated apartheid-era abuses. Over [21,000 victims](https://www.justice.gov.za/trc/) gave testimony, allowing collective healing without resorting solely to punishment. These approaches are especially valuable in deeply divided societies, though their success depends on sincerity, accountability, and reparative action.  
<br />

  
<br />

It could be restorative, an effort to return impaired or lost dignity.  
<br />

Bukod naman sa pakikipag-ayos, ang pag-aayos. Ang muling pagbawi sa dangal ng biktima.  
<br />

**Restorative justice** is victim-centered and dialogical, often involving mediated encounters between offender and victim. Studies show restorative processes increase victim satisfaction rates to over **85%**, compared to just **20%** in conventional courts ([Restorative Justice Council, UK](https://restorativejustice.org.uk/)). In the Philippines, the Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2006 mandates restorative practices for children in conflict with the law. These aim to rebuild dignity while reducing recidivism and reliance on incarceration.  
<br />

  
<br />

It may also be transformative for the whole community or society to be changed for the better.  
<br />

Hustisyang layunin ay pagbabago. Pagtama sa sistema na pinagmumulan ng mali.  
<br />

Hindi lang para sa iilan, kundi para sa lipunan bilang kabuuan.  
<br />

**Transformative justice** goes beyond addressing individual wrongdoing—it asks how systems themselves create the conditions for harm. This framework is rooted in community work, especially within feminist, abolitionist, and anti-colonial movements. For example, many groups in the Global South, including indigenous Lumad communities in Mindanao, practice *communal justice* that centers land rights and cultural healing. Internationally, movements like [Mariame Kaba’s](https://mariamekaba.com/) advocate for transforming institutions—schools, prisons, police—to stop violence before it happens.  
<br />

  
<br />

In whichever process and means we prefer it to be done, justice is to right a wrong.  
<br />

From individual experiences to broader social issues, justice is our ideal and fair way of protecting our rights and punishing wrongdoings.  
<br />

Dahil ang lipunang itinatama ang mali, ay lipunang Makatao  
<br />

We’d like to hear your thoughts!
